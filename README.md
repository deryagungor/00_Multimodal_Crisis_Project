## Overview:

During times of major natural disasters, access to accurate and actionable information is paramount for emergency services and aid providers to maximize their life-saving efforts.

In this project, we focus on classifying information extracted from the CrisisMMD: Multimodal Crisis Dataset. Our primary goal is to develop binary and multiclass classification models to categorize crisis-related content, aiding in the efficient allocation of resources and assistance.

The CrisisMMD dataset serves as the foundation of our project, encompassing a diverse range of multimodal data, including text and images, collected during crisis events. These data provide valuable insights into disaster-related communication and aid decision-making.
